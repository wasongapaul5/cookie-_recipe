<p>     This recipe is from my dad and they are a favorite among friends and family.
  The secret ingredient is the coconut! <em>Be warned</em>, these will fly off of the plate!!These delicious cookies are easy to cook and taste as good as the real Millies cookies, 
  with a crisp outer layer and a gooey centre these treats are best eaten warm but last well...if they last that long!!!      </p>
       <h3> History of cookies </h3> 
 
 <P>Most people don't know the complicated past of the cookie.
What happens when you eat too many cookies?
    â€œWhat happens is you get a huge surge of calories, sugar and fat that your body doesn't need. ... 
    As your blood sugar spikes and then falls post-binge, you'll be more prone to cravings, which can lead to overeating throughout the rest of the day
